## Typecasting

In Python, you cannot perform operations between incompatible data types, such as adding a string to an integer. To resolve this, you must explicitly convert one data type to another, a process known as **typecasting**.

**Example: String + Integer**

```python
a = "Abhishek got marks: "
b = 228

# print(a + b) # This will raise a TypeError

# Correct way: Typecast the integer 'b' to a string
print(a + str(b))
# Output: Abhishek got marks: 228
